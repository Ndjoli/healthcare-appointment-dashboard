## 📈 Recommendations Summary

1. Spread appointments more evenly across the week to reduce Monday–Tuesday congestion.  
2. Shorten long waiting times by increasing provider availability during peak periods.  
3. Introduce a triage system to prioritize urgent cases and reduce delays.  
4. Redistribute tasks from Medical Doctors to Nurses and Psychologists where appropriate.  
5. Train non-physician providers to handle routine consultations to ease workload.  
6. Investigate the cause of declining appointment volumes in certain months.  
7. Boost appointment availability in underutilized months to improve access.  
8. Consider adding reminder systems to reduce patient no-shows (if applicable).  
9. Monitor workload trends across provider roles for better resource planning.  
10. Use data-driven scheduling to align demand with staffing capacity.
